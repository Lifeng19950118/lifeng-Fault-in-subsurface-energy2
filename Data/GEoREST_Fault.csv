Thermal stressing is significantly promoted by cooling-induced fracture permeability enhancement, controlling the stability conditions of the fractures. The spatial and temporal evolution of the sesimic events can only be numerically reproduced by considering a significant contribution of thermal permeability enhancement. Calibration of numerical models against field injectivity data shows that injectivity is governed by the injected fluid temperature. The colder the injected fluid, the higher the injectivity.","Hypocentres of the majority of induced earthquakes are below the injection layer and within the basaltic basement.
